I embarked on a journey to create a cutting-edge hotel reservation system using the powerful MERN stack. This project delved deep into the realms of MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js, introducing me to the core aspects of full-stack development. Through this hands-on experience, I mastered the art of state management with Context API, fortified security with JWT authentication, and optimized functionality through custom hooks. Integrating a sleek React calendar for seamless date selection added finesse to the project. With search filters, multi-step bookings, and an Admin Portal at its core, this venture equipped me with invaluable skills in modern web development, shaping a feature-rich, robust reservation system from the ground up.
